Hercules DJ Controller Driver
=============================

This is a userspace driver for some Hercules DJ controllers.

Originally this was a part of Mixxx,
but in order to issue more timely updates
(not bound to the Mixxx release schedule),
it is now a standalone project.
That means you can use it with any version of Mixxx,
without needing to recompile anything other than this driver.

Since it runs in userspace,
you don't need to keep modifying your kernel to keep it working.
And if the driver crashes,
the rest of your system keeps running.
But please tell me if it crashes!


Supported Controllers
---------------------

* MP3e2
* Steel


How To Run
----------

Also make sure your user can read and write to raw USB devices.
See [this Mixxx wiki page](http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/hercules_dj_control_mp3_e2#usb_hid) for how to do this with udev-based systems (almost every Linux distribution).

Currently, the driver must be started after you plug in a device.
Just run `hdjd` and it will tell you what it found.


Current Issues
--------------

The driver is pretty crappy right now.
If you email me, I'm a lot more likely to fix things.
Even if you just say "hi, I'm using your Hercules driver".

* Driver must be launched after


Thanks
------

Thanks to Guillemot (makers of the Hercules controllers) for sending me
a whole bunch of controllers so I could make a better driver.

Thanks to the Mixxx project for connecting me with Guillemot,
and for providing something interesting to use this driver ;-)
